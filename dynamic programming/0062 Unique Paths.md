# 62. Unique Paths  
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/unique-paths/  

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.


Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 7  
Output: 28  

Example 2:  
Input: m = 3, n = 2  
Output: 3  
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100

``` python3

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp=[1 for i in range(n)]
        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                dp[j]+=dp[j-1]
        
        return dp[-1]
        
```

``` python3

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return comb(m + n - 2, n - 1)
        
```
