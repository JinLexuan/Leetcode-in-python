# 11. Container With Most Water
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/container-with-most-water  
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.Notice that you may not slant the container.

Example 1:  
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]  
Output: 49  
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.  

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]  
Output: 1

Constraints:  
n == height.length  
2 <= n <= 105  
0 <= height[i] <= 104  

``` python3
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left,right=0,len(height)-1
        maxWater=(right-left)*min(height[left],height[right])
        while left<right:
            if (right-left)*min(height[left],height[right])>maxWater:
                maxWater=(right-left)*min(height[left],height[right])
            if height[left]<height[right]:
                left+=1
            else:
                right-=1
        return maxWater
```
